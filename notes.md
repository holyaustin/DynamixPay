Updates needed. All codes should be full complete codes provided.
1. Login. when a user logs in with socials / email, the users name is not shown
2. Dashboard. The dashboard should have the balance of USDCe in their wallet. For those who logged in with socials ans emails, the balance from their embedded wallet should be shown in the dashboard.
2b. I observed that the dashboard used simulated data but now that we want to move to production, lets use real data from the smart contract. 
2c. the Run Payroll, Add Payee and Fund Treasury buttons should be performing their actual tasks respectively.
3. Payrol page: Remove all demo data or simulated data and let it read direct from the smart contract. 
3b. create add payee buttons, Make Start Automation and 
Run Payroll Now buttons in payrol page to perform thrie tasks respectively.
4. Fund Page: connect the page to smart contract so one can deposit into the treaury. 
4b/ The amount button should be small amounts for testing like 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 USDCe
4c. Make sure the Approve & Fund and Direct Transfer buttons performs their respective tasks.

Note: the smart contract address deployed to cronos testnet. TreasuryManager deployed to: 0x084622e6970BBcBA510454C6145313c2993ED9E4

The Application should be able to use the x402 implemented in the app to handle payrol disbursement efficiently.
